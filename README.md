# Mchezopesa-Ltd-Football-analysis

Overview
Create a model to predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly or not.

The two possible approaches (as shown below) have been used to make predictions given the below inputs

Input: Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)
Approach 1: Polynomial approach
The model should use the below features:

Rank of home team
Rank of away team
Tournament type
Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores

Approach 2 Logistic approach
Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home teamâ€™s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)
